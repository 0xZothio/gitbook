# $ZOTH Utility

### Governance and Direction

Participation in Protocol Governance: $ZOTH holders are granted voting rights on key decisions affecting the Zoth ecosystem, including changes to fee structures, treasury management, and future product integrations. This ensures the protocol remains decentralized and aligned with the interests of its community.

### Enhanced Yield and Incentives

Enhanced Yield and Rewards via Staking and Loyalty Integrations: Staking $ZOTH provides users with opportunities for enhanced yield on other Zoth products, such as higher interest rates on Liquid Yield assets holdings (USDZe) or reduced transaction fees. The token is central to loyalty programs designed to reward active and long-term participation in the Zoth network.

### Value Accrual and Sustainability

Protocol Revenue Funds Buybacks and Rewards Long-Term $ZOTH Holders: A portion of the fees generated from Zoth's core business lines, including remittances, Liquid Yield assets yield, and tokenization services, is directed toward the open-market buyback and burn/reward of $ZOTH. This mechanism is designed to:

* Reward long-term holders and stakers.
* Establish a sustainable and deflationary or value-accretive loop for the token, aligning token value with the operational success and revenue growth of the Zoth platform.
