7. **How do you avoid the signed RWA being collateralized on different platforms multiple times?**

We currently work with trusted intermediaries and credit scoring companies who essentially validate if the collateral has already been collateralized. We also ensure we have proper documentation and also rigorous due diligence done on the borrowers and collaterals on the pool.

The collaterals cannot be redeemed until the loan tenure is matured. The only way to redeem the collateral is by paying off the loan that was issued.
