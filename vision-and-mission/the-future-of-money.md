# The Future of Money

### Yield-Native, Compliant, Globally Accessible

Money is evolving from a passive store of value into an active, yield-generating digital asset.\
Users no longer accept 0–2% returns from banks when safe, transparent, on-chain instruments offer materially higher yields. At the same time, global financial systems are moving toward programmable, compliance-aware architectures where:

* stablecoins become the default internet money,
* Tokenized RWAs and high-performing DeFi strategies become the backbone of yield.
* KYC/AML is embedded directly into settlement layers,
* users expect instant global payments, and
* on-chain transparency replaces black-box banking.
