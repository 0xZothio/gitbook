# Our Values

Zoth identified a major gap in the stablecoin market, where retail users were often excluded from accessing sustainable financial tools. By addressing key challenges, focusing on emerging markets, and unlocking the potential of stablecoins, Zoth seeks to empower communities worldwide. Innovative products like fixed-income RWAs provide the unbanked with opportunities for financial inclusion and economic growth, enabling their participation in a more equitable financial system.

> Zoth envisions a future where financial infrastructure is open, transparent and permissionless, creating a thriving ecosystem that is both community-driven and inclusive.

### 1. Open access to financial opportunities

Today, RWAs are often confined within institutional barriers, restricting community access to valuable fixed-income opportunities. By reimagining tokenization and leveraging DeFi, we aim to unlock RWAs, enabling them to flow freely in a permissionless, omni-chain, and community-driven manner. ZeUSD empowers users to seamlessly engage in lending, borrowing, liquidity provision, and yield generation strategies. By democratizing access to high-quality RWA-backed products, ZeUSD benefits retail users, institutional investors, and DeFi participants alike.

### 2. Empowering Credit with Risk-Optimized Solutions

Trust is the cornerstone of our financial ecosystem, exemplified through **Zoth Secure Trade Finance (ZSTF)**. This product focuses on secured, short-term receivables sourced from esteemed factoring companies in emerging markets, providing a reliable and globally secure asset class. ZSTF embraces diversified risk by factoring invoices from different borrowers, backed by multiple layers of risk mitigation strategies such as first loss coverage guarantee, Corporate Guarantee, Promissory notes, and Institutional credit guarantees/Trade Insurance.

### 3. High-quality fixed income products

Fairness drives our commitment to equitable financial inclusion. With **Zoth Tokenized Liquid Note Prime (ZTLN-P)**, accredited and professional investors gain regulatory-compliant access to USD-denominated, investment-grade fixed-income portfolios via blockchain technology. ZTLN-P focuses on low-risk, high-quality instruments such as U.S. Treasury Bills, Corporate Bonds, and MMF/ETFs like [iShares](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf-fund) managed by BlackRock.

This product balances performance and security by diversifying risk across top-rated bonds and treasury bills, while its comprehensive liquidity solutions ensure smooth operations within stringent regulatory standards. By offering access to high-quality assets, ZTLN-P sets a benchmark in on-chain finance for professional investors seeking stability and growth.

### 4. Ecosystem by the community, for the community

Zoth’s ecosystem is built to empower communities and redefine access to financial opportunities. Supporting this vision is [**Zoth Atlas**](https://atlas.zoth.io), our permissionless gateway to RWAs. By providing frictionless, compliant access to institutional-grade financial products, Zoth Atlas fosters financial inclusion and long-term wealth creation.

At Zoth, our values of **Transparency**, **Trust**, and **Fairness** are not just guiding principles-- they are the foundation of our approach to bridging traditional and on-chain finance. By combining education, innovation, and community-driven solutions, we aim to unlock the full potential of RWAs and empower individuals globally.

> Through products like **ZeUSD**, **ZSTF**, and **ZTLN-P**, we ensure that our community remains at the center of everything we do, driving sustainable economic growth and financial inclusion for all.
