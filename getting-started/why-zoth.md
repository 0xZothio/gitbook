# Why Zoth

Zoth exists to close the biggest gaps in the stablecoin market by uniting issuance, compliance, and adoption into one full-stack ecosystem. Our team brings proven expertise, having scaled a stablecoin to $30M in circulation within just six weeks, and we operate under the oversight of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) and the BVI Financial Services Commission. This strong regulatory foundation ensures trust, transparency, and security for institutions looking to build at scale.

The challenges facing stablecoin issuers today are clear: launching is slow and cumbersome, requiring months, sometimes years of coordination. The process is fragmented across multiple partners, each handling only a piece of the puzzle, while the lack of a proven distribution playbook means most projects fail to gain traction. Even after launch, very few manage to break into real-world adoption, leaving stablecoins stranded as products without meaningful utility.

Zoth solves these challenges end to end. At its core, Zoth is built on enterprise-grade infrastructure with integrated risk and reserve management, delivering the resilience and protection needed for long-term stability. Beyond infrastructure, Zoth provides a built-in growth engine by leveraging its own products and partner ecosystem, helping issuers move beyond launch to real-world adoption and scale. Stablecoin Studio serves as the end-to-end platform for issuance and management, ZeUSD creates a yield-bearing stablecoin with utility embedded, PayX7 enables cross-border remittances for global payments, and FAAST introduces a regulated tokenization service that bridges traditional finance with the onchain economy.

By combining regulatory cover, secure infrastructure, and ready-made adoption channels, Zoth enables institutions, banks, corporates, and fintechs to launch, scale, and monetize stablecoins in under 90 days, creating a clear pathway from concept to global utility.
