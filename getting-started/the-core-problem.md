# The Core Problem

### Fragmented, Inefficient, and Exclusionary Financial Infrastructure

Despite rapidly growing digital economies, the global financial system remains structurally exclusionary. An estimated 1.4 billion adults worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to basic banking, savings, and payment infrastructure. Even among the banked, financial services are often costly, slow, and inefficient, particularly across emerging markets and high-friction corridors.

While neobanks and digital wallets have improved surface-level user experience, they have largely failed to transform underlying financial outcomes. Most operate on legacy banking rails, resulting in delayed settlement cycles, high foreign exchange spreads, and near-zero yield on customer balances. Capital remains idle within closed banking systems, disconnected from crypto-native yield generation and tokenized real-world asset (RWA) opportunities that could materially improve savings performance and income resilience.

At the infrastructure layer, the stablecoin ecosystem remains fragmented and institutionally underdeveloped. Although over 100 stablecoins exist, only a small subset operate at meaningful scale, and even fewer meet enterprise-grade requirements for compliance, reserve transparency, cross-jurisdictional operability, and programmable controls. There is no unified, enterprise-ready platform enabling institutions to launch, manage, and scale fully compliant stablecoins across borders with embedded privacy and automation capabilities.

These structural inefficiencies are most visible in cross-border payments. Remittances and business settlements continue to incur high fees (3–8%), multi-day settlement windows, and elevated counterparty and chargeback risk. This disproportionately impacts individuals and SMEs in emerging markets, while also constraining the emerging agentic economy, where autonomous AI agents and digital businesses require instant, programmable, low-friction value transfer to operate effectively at global scale.

Without modern, programmable financial infrastructure, both human participants and autonomous economic actors remain constrained by systems designed for a pre-digital era.
