# Overview of the Current Stablecoin Market

Currency pegging has long been a foundational practice in global finance, facilitating trade stability and economic integration across borders. Historically, systems such as the Gold Standard provided a common benchmark for value, enabling nations to anchor their currencies and reduce exchange rate for volatility.

In the modern era, pegging remains integral to economic policy, with nations often aligning their currencies to more stable or widely accepted standards. As of the recent estimates, the US Dollar (USD) and Euro (ER) are the most commonly pegged currencies globally, with over 65% of global trade transactions settled in USD alone.

As stablecoins evolved, new models emerged that moved away from traditional fiat backing, focusing on decentralization, flexibility, and reducing reliance on centralized reserves.

As of now the stablecoin market has experienced explosive growth, reaching a market capitalization of approximately **$203.15 billion** as of late 2024, marking a significant increase of nearly 10% within the month. Tether's USDT continues to dominate the market, holding about **70% of the total stablecoin value**, with its market cap **rising to around $133 billion,** as of 2024. Circle's USDC has also shown substantial growth, increasing its market cap to approximately $39.5 billion.

Despite their growth and adoption, the leading stablecoin models, often not designed with the core values of crypto, such as decentralization and permissionless access in mind, face several significant challenges that must be addressed for true scalability and adoption in the RWAfi space. These include:

* **Centralization of Reserves: -** Most widely used stablecoins are centralized, meaning they rely on a single entity to manage reserves. This centralization poses risks related to transparency and trust, as users must rely on the issuer's integrity regarding asset backing.
* **Unreliable Backing -** Many successful stablecoins struggle with reliable backing. This is due to reliance on volatile native tokens in the case of certain algorithmic stablecoins, lack of audits on the reserves, or having highly volatile assets as collateral.
* **Yield / Revenue Distribution -** Stablecoin companies like Tether generate substantial profits from the interest earned on their collateral reserves. While Web3's core philosophy emphasizes sharing revenue with users and the community, most stablecoin protocols have not adopted this approach of distributing their yields to their users.
* **Fragmented Liquidity and Interoperability -** As multiple stablecoins proliferate, the lack of interoperability between different blockchain networks can hinder their usability across platforms, limiting their potential applications in the broader economy.
