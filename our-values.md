# Our Values

Zoth identified a major gap in the stablecoin market, where retail users were often excluded from accessing sustainable financial tools. **Highlighting challenges, focusing on emerging markets, and unlocking the potential of stablecoins to empower communities.** Products like fixed-income RWAs provide the unbanked with opportunities for financial inclusion and growth, enabling them to participate in a more equitable financial system. Zoth envisions a future where financial infrastructure is open, transparent, and permissionless, creating a thriving ecosystem that is both community-driven and inclusive.

#### Permissionless: Open access to financial opportunities

ZeUSD is a fully composable RWA-backed Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) stable token designed to bring sustainable financial opportunities to the community. Today, RWAs are often confined within institutional barriers, restricting community access to valuable fixed-income opportunities. By reimagining tokenization and leveraging DeFi, we aim to unlock RWAs, enabling them to flow freely in a permissionless, omnichain, and community-driven manner. ZeUSD empowers users to seamlessly engage in lending, borrowing, liquidity provision, and yield generation strategies. By democratizing access to high-quality, RWA-backed assets, ZeUSD benefits retail users, institutional investors, and DeFi participants alike.

#### Fairness: Empowering Credit with Risk-Optimized Solutions

Trust is the cornerstone of our financial ecosystem, exemplified through **Zoth Secure Trade Finance (ZSTF)**. This product focuses on secured, short-term receivables sourced from esteemed factoring companies in emerging markets, providing a reliable and globally secure asset class. ZSTF embraces Diversified Risk by factoring invoices from different borrowers, backed by multiple layers of risk mitigation strategies such as first loss coverage guarantee, promissory notes, and institutional credit guarantees.

#### Quality Assets: High quality fixed income products

Fairness drives our commitment to equitable financial inclusion. With **Zoth Tokenized Liquid Note Prime (ZTLN-P)**, accredited and professional investors gain regulatory-compliant access to USD-denominated, investment-grade fixed-income portfolios via blockchain technology.

ZTLN focuses on low-risk, high-quality instruments such as U.S. Treasury Bills, Corporate Bonds and iShares managed by BlackRock.

By offering access to high-quality assets, ZTLN sets a benchmark in on-chain finance for professional investors seeking stability and growth

#### Community First: Ecosystem by the community, for the community

Zothâ€™s ecosystem is built to empower communities and redefine access to financial opportunities. Supporting this vision is **Zoth Atlas**, our permissionless gateway to RWAs. By providing frictionless, compliant access to institutional-grade financial products, Zoth Atlas fosters financial inclusion and long-term wealth creation.

At Zoth, our values of **Transparency**, **Trust**, and **Fairness** are not just guiding principles-- they are the foundation of our approach to bridging traditional and on-chain finance. By combining education, innovation, and community-driven solutions, we aim to unlock the full potential of RWAs and empower individuals globally.

Through products like **ZeUSD**, **ZSTF**, and **ZTLN**, we ensure that our community remains at the center of everything we do, driving sustainable economic growth and financial inclusion for all.
