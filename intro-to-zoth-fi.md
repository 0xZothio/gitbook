# Intro to ZOTH - FI

Zoth - Fixed Income (Zoth-Fi) is an Institutional Grade Fixed Income Marketplace, that facilitates qualified investos to experience top-tier, sustainable, and compliant fixed-income opportunities designed for the future through stablecoins.

Zoth-Fi focuses on high-quality assets, sustainable yield, and world-class client service. It brings financial assets onto blockchain rails for DeFi integrations and efficient global markets. The platform provides secure access to top-tier, short-term assets, ensures compliance across multiple jurisdictions, offers tailored investment options, diversifies portfolios with real-world asset yields, and delivers comprehensive liquidity solutions.

The Zoth pools are the heart of the platform, offering three major functionalities that drive its ecosystem. Firstly, they facilitate the listing of Real-World Assets (RWAs), acting as a bridge between traditional finance and on-chain finance through the tokenization and listing of these assets. Secondly, these pools provide investors (LPs) with opportunities to invest in RWAs and earn yields on their investments. Lastly, Zoth governance plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and viability of the RWAs through rigorous validation and due diligence processes, for which they are compensated by Zoth.
