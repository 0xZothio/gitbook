# The Zoth Ecosystem

### Unifying Yield, Payments, Cards, and Compliance

Zoth is building a privacy-first stablecoin neobank for the Global South and the emerging Agentic Economy, an integrated financial infrastructure that unifies yield, payments, cards, liquidity, compliance, and security into a single, institution-grade platform.

At the center of the ecosystem is USDZe, a Liquid Yield Asset engineered to deliver sustainable returns through diversified RWA and DeFi strategies, built on a transparent, compliant, and fully auditable framework. Designed for both human and machine-native participants, USDZe enables programmable capital that can seamlessly interact with autonomous agents, global businesses, and next-generation financial applications.

Zoth combines the accessibility of a neobank, the transparency of blockchain, and the performance of institutional-grade treasury solutions to create a complete next-generation financial layer for individuals, enterprises, and autonomous systems, providing:

* Instant Liquidity: Direct access to USDZe balances via the integrated Zoth Card.
* Instant Global Settlement: Near-zero-cost, borderless money movement optimized for high-frequency, agent-driven and cross-border transactions.
