# Welcome to ZOTH

> Zoth is an RWA ecosystem bringing institutional-grade yield avenues onchain.

Zoth is an RWA ecosystem that connects institutional-grade yield opportunities from traditional finance to onchain finance, bridging the gap seamlessly.

Zoth believes that the convergence of Traditional Finance and Onchain Finance is inevitable. Onchain finance is poised to experience a substantial influx of institutional capital amounting to trillions of dollars, coupled with the tokenization of high-market capitalization traditional assets.\


**ZOTH - FI Platform**

The inaugural offering, ZOTH - Fixed Income (ZOTH-FI), represents an institutional grade Fixed Income marketplace, that facilitates investor access to top-tier Fixed Income assets through stablecoins. Experience access to top-tier, sustainable, and compliant fixed-income opportunities designed for the future through stablecoins.

By bringing traditional financial assets onto blockchain rails, Zoth-Fi offers secure onchain access to top-tier assets like Secure Trade Finance receivables, US Treasury Bills, and top-rated Corporate Bonds. We ensure stringent compliance across multiple jurisdictions, managing investments within regulatory standards. Zoth provides tailored investment options for liquidity, risk, and return, allowing qualified investors to access current and upcoming opportunities.

#### Mission

Zoth envisions a future where the boundaries between TradFi and Onchain Fi are blurred, enabling new opportunities for secure yield, enhanced liquidity and efficient tokenizing mechanisms for RWAs.
