# Introduction

**Zoth** is building a **community-powered RWAFi Ecosystem** to address the broken state of **Real-World Assets (RWAs).** For too long, RWAs were confined to institutional circles, stifling their potential for democratization. Zoth breaks down these barriers by providing a decentralized ecosystem that connects liquidity across **Traditional Finance (TradFi)** and **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**, enabling a free flow of assets and capital.

We believe that the widespread adoption of RWAFi within DeFi requires the active participation of retail investors, which has historically been limited by fragmented systems and unfair incentives. Zoth is dedicated to creating an inclusive system where retail investors are not just spectators, but active participants who fuel the growth of RWAs in DeFi. This includes creating a more accessible and fairer ecosystem where previously locked fixed-income assets can be freely utilized across DeFi.

Our vision is to build an end-to-end RWAFi ecosystem that combines new financial instruments with the stability of TradFi and the scalability of DeFi.&#x20;

> **Together, we're democratizing access to the creation and management of omni-chain, composable, yield-bearing RWA-backed products on-chain.**
