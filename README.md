# Introduction

Zoth is building the first full-stack **StableFi OS**, a complete infrastructure that empowers institutions, banks, corporates, and fintechs to launch, scale, and monetize stablecoins in under 90 days.&#x20;

Unlike existing platforms that only provide technology and legal frameworks, Zoth takes a holistic approach by integrating regulatory cover, dynamic reserve and risk management, and a built-in adoption and distribution network. This ensures that every stablecoin launched through Zoth is not only secure and compliant but also positioned for real-world liquidity and growth.&#x20;

> By bridging the gap between Traditional Finance and Decentralized Finance, Zoth is creating resilient infrastructure that enables stablecoins to move beyond issuance toward sustainable adoption, utility, and scale, bringing the worldâ€™s financial systems onchain.
