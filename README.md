# The Zoth Ecosystem

### Unifying Yield, Payments, Cards and Compliance

Zoth is building a privacy-first stablecoin neobank ecosystem—an integrated financial infrastructure that unifies yield, payments, cards, liquidity, compliance, and security into a single, institution-grade platform.\
\
At the center of the ecosystem is USDZe, a Liquid Yield Asset engineered to deliver sustainable returns through diversified RWA and DeFi strategies, built on a transparent, compliant, and fully auditable framework.

Zoth combines the ease of a neobank, the transparency of blockchain, and the performance of institutional-grade treasury solutions to create a complete next-generation financial layer for both retail and enterprise users, providing:

* Instant Liquidity: Direct access to USDZe balances via the integrated Zoth Card.
* Instant Global Settlement: Near-zero cost, Global money movement.
