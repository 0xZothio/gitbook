# The Core Problem

### Fragmented, Inefficient, and Exclusionary Financial Infrastructure

Despite rapidly growing digital economies, the global financial system remains structurally exclusionary. An estimated 1.4 billion adults worldwide are still unbanked, lacking access to basic banking, savings, and payment infrastructure. Even among the banked, financial services remain costly, slow, and inefficient—particularly in emerging markets.

\
While neobanks and digital wallets have improved user experience at the surface level, they have failed to deliver meaningful financial outcomes. Most are built on legacy banking backends, resulting in slow settlement cycles, high foreign exchange costs, and near-zero yield on user balances. As a result, billions of dollars in global capital remain idle and underutilized, with no access to crypto-native yield or tokenized real-world asset (RWA) opportunities that could materially improve savings and income outcomes.

\
At the infrastructure layer, the stablecoin ecosystem remains fragmented and immature. Although over 100 stablecoins exist, only a small subset are viable at institutional scale due to gaps in compliance, on-chain transparency, and trusted reserve frameworks. Critically, there is no unified, enterprise-grade platform that enables institutions to launch, manage, and scale fully compliant stablecoins across jurisdictions.

\
These inefficiencies are most visible in cross-border payments. Remittances and business settlements continue to suffer from high fees (3–8%), multi-day settlement windows, and elevated counterparty and chargeback risk. This disproportionately impacts individuals and SMEs in emerging markets, where access to fast, affordable, and reliable global payments is essential for economic participation.
