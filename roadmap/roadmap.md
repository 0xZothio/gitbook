# Roadmap

The initial phase focuses on launching the Core Yield Product, beginning with the introduction of ZEUSD, a Liquid Yield asset backed by a diversified reserve comprising real-world assets and DeFi strategies. This phase also includes the integration of virtual card issuance and global payment rail infrastructure to enable seamless spending and payments. In parallel, the $ZOTH Token Generation Event (TGE) will be executed to support network participation and ecosystem growth.<br>

The second phase emphasizes licensing and scalable infrastructure. During this stage, Zoth will secure a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in the United Arab Emirates to ensure regulatory compliance and operational legitimacy. Physical Zoth cards will be launched, alongside the rollout of zero-fee global remittances enabled through blockchain partnerships and integrated fiat on- and off-ramps. This phase also introduces the Zoth mobile application, featuring smart, abstracted accounts and automated yield mechanisms designed to simplify user experience while maximizing capital efficiency.The third phase delivers full neobank functionality. ZEUSD will be expanded to support additional asset classes and deeper integrations across DeFi protocols, strengthening liquidity and yield opportunities. Lending capabilities will be introduced, allowing users to borrow against their ZEUSD holdings. At the same time, ZEUSD will be integrated into external fintech platforms and neobanks, extending its utility across both crypto-native and traditional financial ecosystems.<br>

The final phase is dedicated to expansion and market leadership. Zoth will enter traditional finance lending and over-the-counter liquidity markets while establishing a direct presence in regions with high demand for dollar-denominated financial products, including Turkey, Argentina, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. To support regional adoption, the platform will deploy native-language interfaces and local operational teams, ensuring regulatory alignment, cultural relevance, and long-term market dominance.
