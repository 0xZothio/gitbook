# Technical Infrastructure and Availability

#### <mark style="color:$info;">Multi-Chain Deployment</mark>

Zoth initially deploys on Base and Ethereum, with technical architecture designed for rapid expansion to additional EVM-compatible blockchains as user demand and strategic opportunities emerge. This multi-chain capability provides operational flexibility and reduces concentration risk on single blockchain networks.

The protocol's versatile infrastructure allows deployment to new EVM chains with minimal development effort, enabling quick response to evolving blockchain adoption patterns, fee structures, and user preferences. However, each new chain deployment introduces integration risks and requires security validation of chain-specific components before production use.

#### <mark style="color:$info;">Infrastructure Monitoring and Resilience</mark>

Backend infrastructure implements load balancing across distributed servers to maintain performance and availability during high-traffic periods. This horizontal scaling capability ensures that the platform remains responsive even when transaction volumes surge during periods of market volatility or viral user adoption.

Continuous monitoring systems track infrastructure health, transaction processing latency, and service availability across all system components. Alerting mechanisms notify engineering teams immediately when anomalies or degraded performance are detected, enabling rapid response to emerging technical issues.

The protocol maintains comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity plans covering scenarios including data center failures, cloud provider outages, and catastrophic security incidents. While specific technical details remain confidential for operational security reasons, these plans ensure that critical protocol functions can be restored with minimal disruption even in severe failure scenarios.<br>
