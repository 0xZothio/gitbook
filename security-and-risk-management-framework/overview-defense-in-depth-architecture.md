# Overview: Defense-in-Depth Architecture

Zoth implements a comprehensive, multi-layered security framework designed to protect user capital, maintain protocol integrity, and ensure operational resilience across all system components. The security architecture operates on defense-in-depth principles, where multiple independent security controls work in concert to prevent, detect, and respond to threats at the smart contract, operational, and infrastructure layers.

The protocol's risk management philosophy recognizes that no single security measure is sufficient in isolation. Instead, Zoth combines proactive security controls (code audits, formal verification, access controls), real-time threat detection (AI-powered transaction monitoring, anomaly detection), reactive mechanisms (pause functionality, incident response protocols), and economic incentives (bug bounties, attestor liability) to create a resilient security posture capable of withstanding sophisticated attacks and operational failures.
