# User Responsibilities and Risk Disclosure

### Informed Participation

Participation in the Zoth protocol requires users to understand and accept the full spectrum of risks described in this section and disclosed elsewhere in protocol documentation. The protocol provides transparency regarding architecture, risk factors, and operational practices, but cannot and does not guarantee capital preservation, return generation, or protection against all potential losses.

Users are responsible for conducting appropriate due diligence before allocating capital, including assessment of technical risks, fund manager capabilities, legal and regulatory status, and alignment with their individual risk tolerance and investment objectives. The protocol does not provide investment advice, and users should consult qualified financial advisors when appropriate.

### No Complete Risk Elimination

Despite comprehensive security measures, rigorous development practices, and institutional-grade operational standards, no protocol can eliminate all risks. Smart contract vulnerabilities, operational failures, market disruptions, regulatory actions, and other adverse events may occur that result in partial or total loss of user capital.

Users should allocate only capital they can afford to lose and should maintain appropriately diversified portfolios that limit exposure to any single protocol, strategy, or manager. The high yields potentially available through Zoth reflect genuine underlying risks, and users should be skeptical of any claims of risk-free returns.

The protocol team remains committed to continuous security improvement, transparent risk disclosure, and rapid response to emerging threats. However, user vigilance, informed participation, and realistic risk assessment remain essential components of safe protocol interaction.
