# Governance

Zoth operates a governance model through the Zoth DAO to ensure the seamless operation of the protocol. This model includes various elements, such as enhancements to the protocol, access based on rules, financial aspects, and organizational governance, aiming to create a transparent and efficient ecosystem for DAO members. Holders of ZOTH tokens run the governance.

**Participation:** The Zoth governance framework determines the criteria for asset managers and investors to participate in the protocol. These criteria become critical in ensuring standardized and secure onboarding of users on the platforms. Zoth utilizes a delegated validation mechanism for participants to delegate the rights of onboarding an asset manager to a qualified validator. Qualification criteria for asset managers and validators will be announced soon, ensuring a fair and transparent selection process.

**Fee Structure**: Zoth adopts a comprehensive fee strategy, considering both the fees for investors and the staking requirements for asset managers. This approach facilitates the determination of equitable fee or staking amounts for asset owners and investors alike, maintaining a balanced and sustainable economic model within the ecosystem.

**Protocol Updates:** The Zoth governance framework allows protocol participants to propose improvements across diverse areas. This participatory approach ensures that the Zoth protocol remains adaptive, innovative, and aligned with the evolving needs of its users.

By maintaining a clear and systematic governance model, Zoth aims to cultivate a strong framework for the community that fosters transparency, inclusivity, and growth within the protocol. By adhering to the governance principles, we create a thriving ecosystem that benefits all participants and upholds the integrity of the protocol.
