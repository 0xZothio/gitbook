# What Are Zocta Points?

Zocta Points are Zoth’s ecosystem-wide loyalty units designed to drive long-term engagement without introducing direct financial risk or yield guarantees. Zocta reinforces positive user behavior across the Zoth ecosystem—saving, spending, transacting, and participating—by rewarding consistency and contribution rather than short-term speculation. Zocta is non-monetary by design, ensuring regulatory clarity while enabling meaningful, programmatic incentives.
