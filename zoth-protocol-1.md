# Zoth Protocol

As the RWAfi space continues to evolve, Zoth Protocol integrates traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling investors to participate in fixed-income opportunities in a seamless and decentralized manner.

Zoth caters to both **on-chain RWA holders and traditional fixed-income holders.** For users who already possess eligible RWA collateral, can collateralize their holdings through Zothâ€™s escrow contracts. Traditional fixed-income holders, including investors in instruments such as money market funds, treasury securities, or private credit, can collateralize these assets via escrow custody.

Once assets are collateralized, Zoth's protocol (ZothFI) calculates the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the eligible collateral and issues **ZeUSD**, a dollar-pegged stable token backed by the RWA collateralized debt position. ZeUSD can be locked in for ZeUSD+, which distributes yield earned from the underlying collateral.

ZeUSD and ZeUSD+ are designed to be composable within the DeFi ecosystem, meaning they can integrate seamlessly with other blockchain applications. As omnichain tokens, they operate across multiple blockchain networks, boosting liquidity and utility.

By allowing users to collateralize their eligible offchain and onchain RWAs, Zoth unlocks an opportunity to bring the $2 trillion fixed income industry on chain. Through ZeUSD, collateral providers can transform their non-productive RWAs into on chain composable, yield-bearing stable tokens, improving their assets' overall liquidity and utility. This approach, coupled with the right incentives to the collateral providers, increases the net inflow of high-quality fixed-income instruments on-chain.

While brining the asset onchain is only the first step, creating a robust, permissionless DeFi layer is equally critical to realizing the full potential of RWAs. Zoth is not only enabling the onchain layer for RWAs but is also constructing a fully composable, community-driven RWAfi ecosystem. We envision a future where the barriers of traditional finance are eliminated, and the benefits of RWAfi are accessible to all through a permissionless and transparent DeFi experience.

Zoth - Fixed Income (Zoth-Fi) is an Institutional Grade Fixed Income Marketplace, that facilitates qualified investors to experience top-tier, sustainable, and compliant fixed-income opportunities designed for the future through stablecoins.

Zoth-Fi focuses on high-quality assets, sustainable yield, and world-class client service. It brings financial assets onto blockchain rails for DeFi integrations and efficient global markets. The platform provides secure access to top-tier, short-term assets, ensures compliance across multiple jurisdictions, offers tailored investment options, diversifies portfolios with real-world asset yields, and delivers comprehensive liquidity solutions.

The Zoth pools are the heart of the platform, offering three major functionalities that drive its ecosystem. Firstly, they facilitate the listing of Real-World Assets (RWAs), acting as a bridge between traditional finance and on-chain finance through the tokenization and listing of these assets. Secondly, these pools provide investors (LPs) with opportunities to invest in RWAs and earn yields on their investments. Lastly, Zoth governance plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and viability of the RWAs through rigorous validation and due diligence processes, for which they are compensated by Zoth.
