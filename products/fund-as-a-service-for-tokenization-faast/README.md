# Fund-as-a-Service for Tokenization (FAAST)

## Introduction

Fund-as-a-Service for Tokenization (FAAST) is a ready-to-use fund and tokenization platform/infrastructure that lets anyone - from asset managers to Real World Asset (RWA) protocols - create a fully compliant, regulated investment product on-chain in just days.\
\
FAAST blends institutional-grade protections-regulated fund wrappers, licensed custody, audits, and KYC/KYB, with DeFi-native speed and transparency-tokenized fund units, on-chain reporting, and seamless subscriptions/redemptions.

Think of it as a "launchpad for tokenized funds" - you bring the asset idea, FAAST provides the legal wrapper, infrastructure, and operations. From the legal wrapper to infrastructure and day‑to‑day operations, Zoth runs your entire backend, so you can focus entirely on sales, investor relationships, and business growth.\
\
Whether you’re a traditional finance player entering Web3 or a Web3 builder aiming to meet institutional standards, FAAST gives you the shortest path to a compliant, ready-to-Launch RWA fund.
