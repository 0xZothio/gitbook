<summary>Why should I use FAAST instead of building my own setup?</summary>

Because building your own structure  isn’t just about tech, you’ll need deep legal and compliance expertise to meet complex regulatory requirements. This process can take 6–12 months and cost hundreds of thousands in legal reviews, licensing, and compliance overheads. FAAST lets you go live in few days with 40–60% lower costs.&#x20;
