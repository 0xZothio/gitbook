# How It Works?

### One time Setup Process

1. Choose Your Asset Strategy: Treasury bills, private credit, real estate, gold, or other RWAs.
2. Set Up Segregated Portfolio (SP): Your fund sits inside a Cayman Islands SPC, with your own branding, token, and legal ring-fencing from other portfolios

### Investment Process

3. KYC/KYB Investors: Onboard accredited/institutional LPs via regulated fund admin.
4. Deposit Funds: Accept fiat or stablecoins via licensed OTC channels.
5. Deploy Capital: Invest in target assets through licensed investment managers and brokers.
6. Tokenize Assets: Issue compliant tokens backed by RWAs (private credit, real estate, capital markets, gold, etc.).

### Monthly Reporting Process

7. Ongoing NAV & Reporting: Full transparency with regular NAV calculations and audits
