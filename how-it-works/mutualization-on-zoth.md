# Mutualization on Zoth

#### Mutualization of Yield / Rewards

Mutualization in this context allows us to create a pool of interest or reward rates that offers exciting opportunities for both borrowers and investors.

In this scenario, we have three key participants: the Emerging Market Borrowers (Y), the Financial Institutions/Private Lenders/Zoth (Z), and individuals like yourself who contribute to the mutual pool. Let's delve into the process step by step:

1. Borrowing: As an emerging market borrower, you may require funds for various purposes. Our platform connects you with Financial Institutions/Private Lenders/Zoth (Z) that provide loans to cater to your financial needs effectively.
2. Liquidity Creation: Instead of having individual interest or reward rates, mutualization allows us to create a diversified pool of interest or reward rates. This pool offers enhanced liquidity and investment opportunities to our users.
3. Rental Basis: Investors can participate in the mutual pool by contributing their interest or reward rates. Each user's interest or reward rate (Qi) is associated with a specific value or percentage (Pi). The total value of the pool (V) is calculated as the sum of all contributions: V = Sum(Pi \* Qi).
4. Mutualized Interest/Rate: To represent the pool, we establish a mutualized interest or reward rate that reflects the combined pool's characteristics. This mutualized rate (Pmut) is determined by dividing the total value of the pool (V) by the number of contributors (Qmut): Pmut = V / Qmut.
5. Returns and Contributions: As an emerging market borrower, you are entitled to a portion of the mutualized interest or reward rates based on your original contribution. The number of mutualized interest or reward rates you receive (Ri) can be calculated using the formula: Ri = (Pi \* Qi) / Pmut.
6. Ongoing Mutualization: The process of mutualization and demutualization is continuous. If additional contributors (j) wish to join the existing mutual pool, their allocation of mutualized interest or reward rates (Rj) will depend on the current pool value (V), the number of contributors, and their new contribution. The formula for calculating Rj is as follows: Rj = (V + Qj \* Pj) / Pmut - Qmut.

By embracing mutualization of interest or reward rates, we create a collaborative platform that brings together Emerging Market Borrowers (Y), Financial Institutions/Private Lenders/Zoth (Z), and individual investors like yourself. This collaboration facilitates the creation of a dynamic pool of interest or reward rates, offering attractive opportunities and returns for all participants.
