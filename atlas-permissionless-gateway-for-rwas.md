# Atlas - Permissionless Gateway for RWAs

Zoth Atlas is designed as a permissionless, community-driven platform to bridge the gap between RWAs and DeFi. Our primary goal through Zoth Atlas is to empower users whether retail participants, institutional investors, or degens with transparent, accessible tools to engage with Real World Assets (RWAs) and explore their financial potential.

At its core, Atlas started as an educational and distribution platform for RWAs. We aim to ensure that the community understands RWAs while offering institutional-grade, RWA-backed tokens in an open, compliant, and frictionless manner. Atlas eliminates the barriers of entry traditionally seen in financial markets by providing permissionless access to high-quality RWA backed assets such as ZeUSD. By democratizing access to RWAs, Zoth Atlas gives the opportunity for Retail users and Institutional Investors

With ZeUSD coming in it distributes through

Atlas in a way that benefits all participants, offering sustainable financial products, yield opportunities, and real utility within the ecosystem. By allowing users to leverage ZeUSD seamlessly.

As of now, Zoth Atlas is available on various pools that offers multiple ways for the users to engage with ZeUSD:

* **Lending and Borrowing Pools:** Users can utilize ZeUSD as collateral to borrow other tokens, enabling lower borrowing rates compared to traditional crypto assets. Since ZeUSD is yield-bearing, the overall borrowing costs are reduced, making it a more efficient and cost-effective solution for users.
* **Yield Positions:** ZeUSD can be utilized in yield markets to generate sustainable returns. These integrations allow users to earn additional yields on their stablecoins while maintaining exposure to low-risk, high-quality assets.
* **Liquidity Pools:** Users can contribute ZeUSD to liquidity pools across various protocols. By providing liquidity, participants earn additional rewards, fostering deeper liquidity for ZeUSD and enabling seamless cross-chain transactions.

The community-driven approach is to make sure that everyone realizes the true potential of RWA and with ZeUSD we are making sure it is a seamless process for them to access institutional-grade and RWA-backed tokens. By focusing on a permissionless, community-centric model, Atlas addresses the inherent challenges in traditional finance, such as limited access, high barriers to entry, and lack of transparency. Zoth Atlas is more than a platform, itâ€™s a movement to redefine how communities interact with RWAs. By empowering users with knowledge, tools, and seamless access to sustainable assets, we aim to create a future where financial opportunities are open to all.
