1. **What is tokenization?**

Tokenization is the process of converting real-world assets, such as invoice factoring, invoice discounting, global trade finance, property, art, or securities, into digital tokens that can be stored, transferred, and traded on a blockchain network. It enables fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and transparency for traditional assets.

2. **What is Zoth protocol?**

Zoth is a DeFi lending protocol bringing emerging market real-world assets to serve small & medium businesses, not served by the regular banking system. Zoth bridges the gap between DeFi liquidity and RWAs in emerging markets. The liquidity module provides a framework to create liquidity for on-chain real-world assets. Zoth also enables the borrowers into the pool to get additional credit by collateralizing their loans.

Zoth is a protocol that facilitates the lending and borrowing of ERC-20 tokens by connecting borrowers and lenders. The protocol acts as a marketplace for loan pools, enabling lenders to earn yield by participating in these pools. The protocol provides the platform but does not participate directly in any deals. Investors must perform their due diligence before depositing funds in any available borrower pools.

13. **How does Zoth assess the risk of the borrowers?**

We have an in-house team to carry out due diligence before we onboard any buyer and use public databases like Coface, and Credit Ssafe, as well. Post validation by our team, the borrower details are further validated by independent third-party on-chain validators as well.

14. **How does the platform ensure funds are safe? What happens if a Borrower defaults?**

Our team closely monitors the performance of the borrower on our platform and the companies whose invoice was discounted or factored.

We create a mutualized pool with around five borrowers and the lender money goes to those different five borrowers through that pool. This strategy reduces the risk of capital loss for the lender. In the worst scenario, if a borrower in that pool makes a default, Zoth also takes insurance cover and in case of default, the insurance company settles the default claim.

## **Platform Risk**

While we make the best attempt to eliminate platform risk and ensure that the platform operates predictably by undergoing code audits for major releases, we make no guarantees on the products.

1. **What happens in the event of a default? What could you do as a lender?**

Generally, Zoth gets post-dated cheques or e-NACH from the borrower, and settlement happens automatically on the due date. The recourse mechanism differs from deal to deal and varies from borrower to borrower.

In the event of a delinquency (i.e. borrower is behind on payments), borrowers will be charged late fees on their loan. The late fee is imposed on top of the regular interest payment and is specified in the loan terms when the pool is created initially. Once the borrower gets back on schedule, additional fees are no longer being imposed.

In such cases, lenders will be receiving additional interest on their loans but may have a different repayment schedule than what was originally planned.

In the case of invoice factoring pool, the insurance company will settle the default and the extent of the settlement will depend on asset to asset, it may range from 70% to 100% of the principal lending amount. However, there may be some time the hat insurance company will take in claim settlement and interest will not be provided for that period.

In other kinds of default, the borrower may request to restructure the deal with the lenders. Zoth may act as a mediator in such scenarios to help both parties reach a favorable outcome. In the worst-case scenario, we can also initiate litigation or arbitration as a last resort for collection if there is no amicable solution.

The lenders must perform, due diligence to understand what type of recourse is available to the lenders in the event of default.

2. **How are you guys going to scale the business?**

We intend to work with asset originators & Fintech lending companies to expand in new continents & geographies and identify borrowers who are ready to borrow funds in stablecoin.

3. **Is legal advice provided to investors?**

While our platform provides information and guidance related to tokenization, we encourage investors to seek independent legal advice specific to their circumstances. Legal advisors can provide personalized guidance on regulatory compliance, taxation, contractual, and any other legal concerns.

4. **How are dividends or income generated from tokenized assets distributed?**

The distribution of dividends or income generated from tokenized assets depends on the specific terms and conditions outlined in the “token agreement.” Typically, dividends or income may be distributed to token holders in proportion to their ownership. Our platform provides visibility into dividend distributions and ensures transparent record-keeping of income generated from tokenized assets.
