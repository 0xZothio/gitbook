Zoth bridges the gap between DeFi liquidity and RWAs in emerging markets. Through the Emerging Market Index Fund, Zoth brings world-class assets into the hands of DeFi Lenders. The liquidity module provides a framework to create liquidity for on-chain real-world assets. Zoth also enables the Lenders into the pool to get additional credit by collateralizing their loan.

Zoth is a protocol that facilitates the lending and borrowing of ERC-20 tokens by connecting borrowers and investors. The protocol acts as a marketplace for loan pools, enabling investors to earn yield by participating in these pools. The protocol provides the platform but does not participate directly in any deals. Investors must perform their due diligence before depositing funds in any available borrower pools.

The platform aims to provide a vast pool of stablecoin liquidity in Zoth, established in Panama. The lenders individual or institutional, will be lending their stablecoins to Zothâ€™s Panama entity.

Established stablecoin liquidity then gets converted into fiat currency through region-specific off-ramps/OTCs and made available for small & medium enterprises (SMEs) needing working capital, through invoice discounting, inventory financing, asset leasing, revenue-based financing, etc.

After conversion, the funds will flow into SPV in different jurisdictions, as per investor interests. From these SPVs, we shall deploy funds by setting up SPVs or AIF or Non-Banking Financial Corporations (NBFCs) in every market to comply with the law of the land. Every country will have its own set of compliances to be done. Therefore, it is helpful to carry out business using different subsidiaries so that due to unforeseen future regulations, changes in one country shall not impact the business happening in other jurisdictions.

Alternatively, the jurisdictions & borrowers who can accept USDC, the borrower can create a wallet on our protocol and can accept liquidity in USDC using a smart contract from our SPV. This will also save the hassles of off-ramping & on-ramping and forex fluctuation coverage.
