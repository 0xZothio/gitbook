    2. The Zoth Protocol operates as a permissionless, decentralized platform on the  Blockchain, allowing users to lend and borrow Digital Assets securely and transparently. Zoth’s non-custodial nature ensures that users retain full control over their funds and private keys at all times.
    3. Core Principles
       * Security: All transactions are governed by audited smart contracts, minimizing counterparty risk.
       * Transparency: Users can access real-time data on the blockchain, ensuring a clear view of their activities and the protocol’s operations.
       * Accessibility: The platform is designed to accommodate retail and institutional users, offering tools and features that cater to diverse needs.
    4. As part of the broader DeFi ecosystem, Zoth integrates seamlessly with other decentralized applications, enabling users to enhance their strategies across multiple platforms.


5.  **SERVICES OFFERED BY ZOTH**\
    \
    Zoth is a protocol that facilitates the lending and borrowing of ERC-20 tokens by connecting borrowers and investors. The protocol acts as a marketplace for loan pools, enabling investors to earn yield by participating in these pools.

    1. **DeFi Lending and Borrowing:** The Zoth Protocol enables users to participate in a decentralized financial ecosystem by connecting borrowers and liquidity providers. Borrowers can access liquidity by pledging eligible collateral in the form of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) or other approved Digital Assets. Liquidity providers, in turn, earn competitive yields by contributing to Loan Pools, with interest and repayment terms governed entirely by smart contracts.
    2. **Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs):** Zoth allows users to create and manage Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) to secure loans against a variety of high-quality collateral, including tokenized Treasury Bills, Money Market Funds (MMFs), Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and other eligible assets. The collateral remains locked in the Zoth Protocol until the loan is repaid, ensuring the safety and stability of the system.
    3. **Usage-Based Incentives :** Zoth provides sustainable and predictable incentive/reward opportunities for investors by leveraging the performance of Real-World Assets (RWAs). Rewards/incentives are generated through borrower repayments, interest rates, and the dynamic rebasing mechanism tied to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying collateral in addition to the minting rewards mentioned in clause 2.16. &#x20;
    4. **Permissionless Loan Pools:** Zoth operates a permissionless model for its Loan Pools, allowing anyone to participate as a lender or borrower without requiring approval from centralized intermediaries. The Loan Pools are accessible on a wide range of blockchain networks, providing participants with unparalleled flexibility and control over their assets.
    5. **Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs):** The Zoth Protocol incorporates tokenized versions of real-world financial instruments, such as Treasury Bills, ETFs, and MMFs, as collateral. This tokenization allows for seamless integration of off-chain assets into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology.
    6. **Integration with the DeFi Ecosystem:** Zoth’s composable and omni-chain design may allow seamless integration with other decentralized financial protocols. Users may leverage Zoth in a variety of DeFi strategies, including:
       * Providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
       * Participating in single-sided liquidity pools
       * Utilizing tokens as collateral in lending and borrowing platforms
       * Yield farming and staking opportunities
    7. **Non-Custodial Asset Management:** ZeUSD is a fully non-custodial CDP, meaning that users retain complete control over their private keys and assets at all times. The Zoth Protocol ensures that transactions are executed securely and transparently through audited smart contracts, with no central authority having custody or access to user funds.&#x20;
    8. **Messaging Layer Services:** The Zoth Protocol includes a secure messaging layer to facilitate communication and coordination among users engaged in decentralized transactions. This service supports efficient interaction between liquidity providers, borrowers, and developers using the platform.
    9. **Cross-Chain Asset Movement:** As an omni-chain protocol, Zoth enables the seamless transfer of Digital Assets across multiple blockchain networks. This functionality allows users to maximize liquidity and leverage opportunities within the broader DeFi ecosystem, regardless of the blockchain network they operate on.
    10. **Transparency and On-Chain Governance:** Zoth ensures full transparency by operating on the blockchain. All transactions and protocol operations are visible to the public on the blockchain, allowing users to verify the integrity of their interactions with the platform. Additionally, Zoth may introduce decentralized governance mechanisms, enabling users to participate in protocol upgrades, fee adjustments, and other critical decisions.
    11. **Regulatory Compliance for Token Issuance:** While the Zoth Protocol operates in a decentralized manner, the issuance of stable tokens such as ZeUSD is subject to compliance with applicable regulations. Stable tokens are only minted against eligible collateral submitted by users through the Zoth platform, ensuring transparency and regulatory alignment.
    12. **Education and Community Support:** Zoth is committed to educating its community about DeFi and blockchain technology. The platform offers resources, guides, and support to help users understand its features, maximize their yield, and make informed decisions.


6. **Zoth Atlas - Permissionless Gateway for Real World Assets (RWAs)**\
   \
   **Zoth Atlas provides a decentralized platform where users can tokenize, trade, or manage real-world assets without needing prior authorization or involvement from centralized intermediaries. In this context, "permissionless" implies that the platform is open to anyone without gatekeeping restrictions, thus enabling broader participation in asset-backed blockchain finance.**\

   1.  Zoth Atlas provides:

       * Educational and Distribution Tools: Ensuring users understand RWAs while offering institutional-grade, RWA-backed tokens in an open, compliant, and user-friendly manner.
       * Permissionless Access: Eliminating traditional financial barriers, Zoth Atlas facilitates unrestricted access to high-quality RWA-backed assets, such as ZeUSD.


7.  **ZeUSD MECHANICS**\
    \
    RWA Collateralization and Minting Process

    1. ZeUSD is minted when users deposit eligible RWAs as collateral to create a CDP. The accepted RWAs include on-chain and off-chain assets such as Treasuries, ETFs, and Money Market Funds.
    2. Collateral Management:
       * On-Chain Assets: Secured through isolated, access-controlled smart contract vaults.
       * Off-Chain Assets: Secured via traditional escrow accounts or omnibus accounts.
    3. Stability through Loan-to-Value Ratios: ZeUSD employs Safe Loan-to-Value ("LTV") ratios to maintain stability and provide a protective buffer against potential fluctuations in the value of the collateral. These LTV ratios are determined based on the characteristics of the underlying RWAs.
    4. Minting Rewards: Users who contribute on-chain or off-chain RWAs to the issuance engine are eligible for minting rewards. These rewards incentivize participation in the ecosystem and contribute to protocol sustainability.
    5. Network Availability: ZeUSD issuance is currently exclusive to the Ethereum, Avalanche, Manta, and Metis networks with plans to expand to additional blockchain ecosystems. As an omnichain token, ZeUSD can be bridged to supported networks post-issuance, enhancing cross-chain operability.


8.  **REDEMPTION MECHANISM**\


    1. Redemption Process: To retrieve collateral, users must repay their outstanding ZeUSD positions and may have to pay a nominal withdrawal fee prior to such withdrawal. These fees contribute to protocol revenue and are distributed among $ZOTH token stakers.
    2. Redemption Fees: Redemption fees are dynamic and may vary based on prevailing protocol conditions. A zero-fee state may also apply, removing cost barriers for redemptions.


9.  **LIQUIDATION MECHANISM**\


    1. Liquidation Conditions: If users fail to redeem their ZeUSD positions, the protocol initiates a liquidation process. This involves:
       * Selling the underlying collateral.
       * Reinvesting the collateral into the same RWA product.
    2. Liquidation Parameters: The LTV ratio of the collateral determines the specific conditions and parameters for liquidation.


10. **FEE, MINTING REWARDS, AND WITHDRAWAL FEES**\

    1. Fee: In connection with your use of the Services, you are required to pay all fees necessary for interacting with the  Blockchain, including transaction costs, as well as all other fees reflected on the Site at the time of your use of the Services. Although we attempt to provide accurate fee information, this information reflects our estimates of fees, which may vary from the actual fees paid to use the Services and interact with the  Blockchain.
    2. You understand that the  Blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the  Blockchain is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the  Blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services.
    3. The Minting Rewards and Withdrawal Fees mechanisms are designed to regulate the supply and demand of ZeUSD, ensuring stability and aligning user incentives with the protocol's goals. Minting rewards are incentives provided to users who contribute eligible Real World Assets (RWAs) as collateral to mint ZeUSD. These rewards encourage the creation of ZeUSD and support the protocol's liquidity and adoption. Withdrawal fees are nominal charges applied when users redeem their collateral by repaying their ZeUSD. These fees disincentivize unnecessary redemptions, help maintain protocol stability, and contribute to the protocol's revenue.
    4. &#x20;High Minting Rewards and Withdrawal Fees:
       * Incentivize the minting of ZeUSD, increasing its supply.
       * Disincentivize the redemption of ZeUSD, creating downward pressure on its price.
    5. &#x20;Low Minting Rewards and Withdrawal Fees:
       * Incentivize users to redeem ZeUSD, decreasing its supply.
       * Disincentivize the minting of ZeUSD, creating upward pressure on its price.
    6. &#x20;Minting Rewards States:
       * Fixed Stability Rate: A predetermined positive rate incentivizes ZeUSD minting.
       * Zero Rate: No minting incentives are provided.
    7.  &#x20;Redemption Fee States:

        * Positive Fee: A non-zero fee applied to discourage redemptions.
        * Zero Fee: No redemption costs apply, encouraging collateral withdrawal.
