# Privacy Policy

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.

**INTRODUCTION:**

Thank you for visiting https://zoth.io/ (hereinafter referred to as “platform”, “protocol” or "Website").

Zoth is a DeFi lending protocol bringing emerging market real-world assets to serve small & medium businesses, not served by the regular banking system. Zoth bridges the gap between DeFi liquidity and RWAs from small & medium businesses and emerging markets. The liquidity module provides a framework to create liquidity for on-chain real-world assets. Zoth is a protocol that facilitates the lending and borrowing of ERC-20 tokens by connecting borrowers and lenders. The protocol acts as a marketplace for loan pools, enabling lenders to earn yield by participating in these pools. The protocol provides the platform but does not participate directly in any deals. Investors must perform their due diligence before depositing funds in any available borrower pools. Zoth’s objective is to accept stablecoin utilizing DeFi liquidity \[staking, yielding, crypto lending applications] and subsequently convert it into fiat currency.
