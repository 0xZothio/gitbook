This protocol is also not intended to provide any investment, financial, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar advice, and nothing on this protocol should be construed as an investment recommendation or strategy. You should consult your own investment, legal, tax and/ or similar professionals regarding your specific situation and any specific decisions. The protocol acts as a facilitator, providing the tools and infrastructure to support lending and borrowing, but it is up to the investors to assess the risk and make informed decisions.

Zoth may have presented certain forward-looking information based on past performance and certain assumptions which may be relevant for current macroeconomic scenarios. However, past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. You should not rely on any past performance as a guarantee of future investment performance. Projections may also not be a reliable indicator of future performance.

The aforesaid list of risk factors is not intended to be exhaustive, nor a comprehensive explanation of the risks involved.

All here provided information has been carefully researched and checked. Despite taking due care, Zoth does not accept any warranty for the information being correct, complete, and up to date.

Similarly, when, where and as required by applicable law, Zoth shall withhold taxes related to your transactions, transfers, distributions, or payments. Applicable legislation could also prompt Zoth to request for additional tax information, status, certificates, or documentation. You acknowledge that failure to answer these requests within the timeframe defined, may result in withholding taxes by Zoth, to be remitted to tax authorities as defined by relevant law. You are encouraged to seek professional and personal tax advice regarding the above and before making any digital asset transaction.
