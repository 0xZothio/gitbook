15. **How does the platform ensure funds are safe? What happens if a Borrower defaults?** &#x20;

Our team closely monitors the performance of the borrower on our platform and the companies whose invoice was discounted or factored.

We create a mutualized pool with around more than one borrower and the lender money goes to these different borrowers through that pool. This strategy reduces the risk of capital loss for the lender. In the worst scenario, if a borrower in that pool makes a default, Zoth also take insurance cover and in case of default, the insurance company settles the default claim. Users are requested to check details in the respective pool where they intend to invest.  &#x20;

16. **What happens in the event of a default? What could you do as a lender?**

Generally, Zoth or asset originator gets post-dated cheques or e-NACH from the borrower, and settlement happens automatically on the due date. Recourse mechanism differs from deal to deal and varies from borrower to borrower. Users are requested to check details in the respective pool where they intend to invest.&#x20;

In the event of a delinquency (i.e. borrower is behind on payments), borrowers will be charged late fees on their loan. The late fee is imposed on top of the regular interest payment and are specified in the loan terms when the pool is created initially. Once the borrower gets back on schedule, additional fees are no longer being imposed.

In such cases, lenders will be receiving additional interest on their loans but may have a different repayment schedule than what was originally planned for.

In case of invoice factoring pool, the insurance company will settle the default and the extent of the settlement will depend on asset to asset, it may range from 70% to 100% of the principal lending amount. However, there may be some time that the insurance company will take time in claim settlement and user shall not be provided yield for that period.&#x20;

In other kinds of default, the borrower may request to restructure the deal with the lenders. Zoth may act as a mediator in such scenarios to help both parties reach a favourable outcome. In the worst-case scenario, we can also initiate litigation or arbitration as a last resort for collection if there is no amicable solution.&#x20;

The lenders must perform due diligence to understand what type of recourse is available to the lenders in the event of default.&#x20;

We intend to work with asset originators & Fintech lending companies to expand in new continents & geographies and identify borrowers ready to borrow funds in stablecoin.

18. **Is legal advice provided to investors?**

While our platform provides information and guidance related to tokenization, we encourage investors to seek independent legal advice specific to their individual circumstances. Legal advisors can provide personalized guidance on regulatory compliance, taxation, contractual, and any other legal concerns.

19. **How are dividends or income generated from tokenized assets distributed?**

The distribution of dividends or income generated from tokenized assets depends on the specific terms and conditions outlined in the “token agreement.” Typically, dividends or income may be distributed to token holders in proportion to their ownership. Our platform provides visibility into dividend distributions and ensures transparent record-keeping of income generated from tokenized assets.
