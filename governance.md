# ZOTH Token

Zoth operates a governance model through the Zoth DAO to ensure the seamless operation of the protocol. This model includes various elements, such as enhancements to the protocol, access based on rules, financial aspects, and organizational governance, aiming to create a transparent and efficient ecosystem for DAO members. The governance model is run by holders of ZOTH tokens.

**Participation:** The Zoth governance framework determines the criteria for asset managers and investors to participate in the protocol. These criteria become critical in ensuring standardized and secure onboarding of users on the platforms. Zoth utilizes a delegated validation mechanism for participants to delegate the rights of onboarding an asset manager to a qualified validator. Qualification criteria for asset managers and validators will be announced soon, ensuring a fair and transparent selection process.

**Fee Structure**: Zoth adopts a comprehensive fee strategy, considering both the fees for investors and the staking requirements for asset managers. This approach facilitates the determination of equitable fee or staking amounts for asset owners and investors alike, maintaining a balanced and sustainable economic model within the ecosystem.

**Protocol Updates:** The Zoth governance framework allows protocol participants to propose improvements across diverse areas. This participatory approach ensures that the Zoth protocol remains adaptive, innovative, and aligned with the evolving needs of its users.

By maintaining a clear and systematic governance model, Zoth aims to cultivate a strong framework for the community that fosters transparency, inclusivity, and growth within the protocol. By adhering to the governance principles, we create a thriving ecosystem that benefits all participants and upholds the integrity of the protocol.

ZOTH, an ERC20 token, is integral to the protocol's operation, facilitating a reduction in dependency on centralized third-party services. The Zoth protocol aims for a phased decentralization of various critical processes, including Asset Validation, Due Diligence, Liquidity, and Sourcing of assets, to ensure the protocol's autonomous and efficient functioning.

**Utility of ZOTH**

The Zoth Protocol, serving as an ecosystem, aims to enhance liquidity flow between Onchain Finance (OnchainFi) and Traditional Finance (TradFi). A significant aspect of ZOTH's utility lies in its ability to obviate intermediaries within this ecosystem, thereby streamlining operations. The intrinsic value of ZOTH is primarily linked to the collection of Transaction Fees and Asset Management Fees. These fees are subsequently distributed among stakers participating in the governance model, thereby incentivizing their involvement in the platform's decision-making processes.

Central to the governance of the Zoth platform is the Zoth DAO, which is instrumental in guiding the protocol towards its strategic objectives. The governance model adopted by Zoth encompasses a wide range of functions, including protocol enhancements, access control based on rules, financial management, and organizational governance, thereby fostering a transparent and efficient environment for DAO members. The governance mechanism is predominantly driven by ZOTH stakers, ensuring a democratic and equitable platform operation.

Key components of the Zoth governance model include:

1.  **Participation**: Zoth governance framework determines the criteria for asset managers and investors to participate in the protocol. This aspect is particularly pivotal for onboarding users into the Zoth Fixed Income platform, where a delegated validation mechanism is employed. Through this mechanism, stakers can assign the responsibility of onboarding asset managers to a suitably qualified validator, thereby maintaining a high standard of participation within the platform.&#x20;

    Zoth is set to announce publicly the specific qualification criteria for asset managers and validators in the near future.
2. **Fee Structure**: Zoth adopts a comprehensive approach towards fee management, balancing the interests of investors and asset managers. By setting forth clear guidelines regarding investment fees and staking requirements for asset managers, the platform aims to establish a fair and transparent financial ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders.
3. **Protocol Updates**: The governance framework of Zoth empowers stakers with the ability to propose and enact modifications across various facets of the platform. This participatory approach ensures that the protocol remains adaptive and responsive to the evolving needs of its users and the broader market dynamics.
