# Governance

#### Governance Model

At Zoth, we have established a robust governance model to ensure the smooth operation of our marketplace. This model encompasses rules-based access, financial considerations, and organizational oversight to create a transparent and efficient ecosystem for our users. Let's explore the key elements of our governance framework:

**Marketplace Governance**

1. Participation: Our governance framework determines the criteria for asset owners and investors to participate in the marketplace. Factors such as geographical location and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements may be considered.
2. Fee Structure: We employ a comprehensive approach to fees, considering both push (fees charged) and pull (staking tiers) models. This enables us to establish appropriate fee or staking amounts for both asset owners and investors.
3. Marketplace Fees: The governance model defines the fees applicable to various stakeholders, including Zoth equity owners, token holders, and the organization itself. This ensures a fair and sustainable financial system within the marketplace.

**Organizational Governance**

1. Marketplace Features: Governance extends to the decision-making process regarding the introduction of new marketplace features. This allows us to continuously enhance the platform and meet the evolving needs of our users.
2. Development Roadmap: The governance framework outlines the development roadmap, ensuring a clear direction for platform enhancements and upgrades. This roadmap is designed to align with our users' requirements and industry trends.
3. Leadership and Compensation: Organizational oversight is an essential aspect of governance. We establish guidelines for leadership roles, ensuring competent and accountable individuals are entrusted with the responsibility of guiding Zoth. Compensation structures for key personnel may also be addressed.
4. Governance Rules: The governance model encompasses the establishment and enforcement of rules that govern various aspects of the platform's operation. These rules promote transparency, fairness, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Zoth Utility Token Governance**

One of the critical aspects of governance is determining the treatment of the Zoth utility token. This includes making decisions on:

* Token Buyback: The governance model defines the amount of tokens to be repurchased using Zoth revenue. This strategic approach ensures the effective management of token supply.
* Token Burning: It specifies the amount of bought back Zoth tokens to be burned, thereby reducing the overall token supply. This can have significant implications for token value and scarcity.
* Distribution to Stakers: The governance model outlines the allocation of bought back Zoth tokens to stakers, rewarding their participation and contribution to the platform.
* Other Token Strategies: Our governance framework allows for the exploration and implementation of additional strategies to enhance the utility and value of the Zoth token.

Through diligent governance, we carefully evaluate the implications of buyback and burning decisions on the token supply. This ensures that our tokenomics align with our long-term vision and the best interests of our token holders.

At Zoth, we are committed to maintaining a strong governance framework that fosters transparency, inclusivity, and growth within our marketplace. By adhering to our governance principles, we create a thriving ecosystem that benefits all participants and upholds the integrity of our platform.
