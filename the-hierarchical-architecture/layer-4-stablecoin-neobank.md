# Layer 4: Stablecoin Neobank

## The Application Layer

The final Stablecoin Neobank layer serves as the user interface, leveraging Account Abstraction smart wallets, Zoth’s Payment Network and the Zocto Card to enable retail and institutional users to save, send, and spend their yield-bearing assets seamlessly. This layer is anchored by two core pillars that redefine the cost and efficiency of global finance:

Zoth Payment Network (PayX7): Functioning as an FX liquidity layer, this network facilitates cross-border and on-ramp/off-ramp settlements through stablecoin rails. The major architectural upgrade in this layer is the use of USDZe as the core settlement asset. By using a yield-bearing asset for money movement, corporates (such as MTOs and insurers) and retail users benefit from a yield-offset mechanism. The 5–10%+ risk-optimised returns generated by USDZe effectively subsidise or subset the costs of money movement, making global transactions nearly zero-cost.

The Zocto Card: This physical and virtual card infrastructure creates a "spend-to-earn" loop. Users can spend USDZe directly for everyday purchases while ensuring their capital remains productive and accrues yield until the exact moment of the spend cycle.
