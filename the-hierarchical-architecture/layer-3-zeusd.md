# Layer 3: ZEUSD

## The Yield Layer

Functioning as the ecosystem’s primary liquidity engine, ZEUSD is a "vault-of-vaults" that receives user capital and, via a risk-weighted allocator contract, feeds that capital into the underlying zVaults based on governance-approved weights. This flow ensures ZEUSD is fully backed by a diversified basket of high-quality assets—such as T-bills, corporate bonds, and market-neutral strategies—to deliver sustainable 5–10%+ risk-optimised returns.
