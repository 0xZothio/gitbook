# Layer 2: zToken Vaults

## The Technology Layer

Built upon this legal substrate is the zToken Vaults technology layer, which consists of specialised, ERC-20 compliant interest-bearing vehicles. These vaults function as tokenised fund shares where the token price appreciates to reflect the accumulated yield from professionally managed strategies across Real-World Assets (RWA), PayFi, and DeFi. Unlike "gambling baskets," each zVault is strictly limited to a curated strategies and risk tier to maintain strategic coherence and operational efficiency. To ensure institutional-grade security, all vault assets are held in Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets, and independent administrators provide biweekly NAV (Net Asset Value) updates via decentralized oracles
