# Zoth FI (Fixed-Income) Platform

**Zoth FI** is an institutional-grade fixed-income marketplace that facilitates on-chain investors to access top-tier fixed-income RWAs directly issued by Zoth.

### Creation of Zoth Issued RWAs

Onboarding an RWA involves curation, due diligence, tokenization, listing, and liquidity management. Zoth FI enables crypto investors to earn high, secure, and sustainable yields from Zoth-issued RWAs.

### **Pools on Zoth FI**

Zoth pools list carefully curated RWAs using the Zoth protocol. In the long run governance participants are responsible for RWA validation and due diligence, earning compensation for their efforts. These pools are central to the platform, facilitating RWA listing (including legal and tokenization), providing investors (LPs) with yield opportunities, and relying on governance for RWA integrity. Investors are also incentivized to provide liquidity.

### **Assets on Zoth FI Platform**

**Investment-Grade Corporate Bonds:**

> Zoth selects investment-grade corporate bonds—debt securities issued by companies with a low risk of default—to offer portfolio diversification and steady income through regular interest payments. While offering lower risk than stocks and providing some protection during downturns, corporate bonds carry the risk of issuer default and are sensitive to interest rate changes, particularly long-term bonds.

**Investment-Grade Sovereign Bonds:**

> Zoth bring relatively low-risk investment-grade sovereign bonds issued by national governments from stable, high-growth emerging markets, providing regular interest payments and principal repayment. These bonds are fundamental for government funding of public services and projects, and serve as benchmarks for borrowing costs in those countries.

**Money Market Funds and Treasury Bills (T-bills):**

> Zoth initially focuses on high-quality, liquid assets like U.S. T-bills and Money Market Funds—short-term government debt obligations sold at a discount, offering low-risk returns upon maturity. The strong economies of issuing nations, particularly the United States, back these safe and highly liquid instruments, making them easily tradable.

**Cross-Border Trade Finance Receivables:**

> Zoth includes diversified, short-term cross-border trade finance receivables—invoices representing debt obligations of importers to exporters—which historically have low default rates. These receivables allow exporters to access advance funding and provide opportunities for diversification in fixed-income portfolios, within a sizable, expanding global trade finance industry.
